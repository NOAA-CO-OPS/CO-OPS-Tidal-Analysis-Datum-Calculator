Description of the test datasets:
- test_timeseries_simple.csv : This is a timeseries from the closest CORA node to the Fernandina Hohonu gauge.
							   It is a 31 day timeseres for October 2022 at hourly spacing. The timeseries is
							   continuous, uniformly spaced, and contains a strong tidal signal without noise.

- test_timeseries_uneventimesampling.csv: This is a timeseries from an RA station provided by Paul Fanelli. The timestamps 
										  in the timeseries are not uniformly spaced
										  and this causes the public version of TADC to error. 
										  The timeseries is about 4 months long at approx 6-minute spacing.
											
- test_timeseries_smallsignal_flatline.csv: This is a timeseries from the closest CORA node to the Topsail Beach Hohonu gauge.
											It is a 31 day timeseres for October 2022 at hourly spacing. The timeseries contains
											a very small amplitude tidal signal (~20 cm) superimposed on a storm driven signal,
											and also contains a multi-day flatline (not NaNs).
											
- test_timeseries_onlyhighs.csv: This is a timeseries from the closest CORA node to the Philadelphia NWLON station. 
								 It is a 31 day timeseres for October 2022 at hourly spacing. The timeseries is NaN
								 except around each high tide.
								 
- test_timeseries_biggap.csv: This is the same timeseries as test_timeseries_simple.csv, but values at indices 400:600 (200 hr) have
							  been replaced with NaNs.
							  
- test_timeseries_nontidal_spikes.csv: This is a CORA timeseries from node number 106 rom the Delaware.netcdf shoreline file.
									   It is only ~6 months of the timeseries, at hourly spacing. The timeseries has no 
									   disernible tidal signal, though has a few very large (>10 sigma from the mean) spikes, 
									   likely representing storms.
									   
- test_timeseries_unreadablevalues.csv: This is a partner station timeseries from Peterson Key FL. It is about 8 months at 6-minute spacing.
										Timestamps are in ISO8601 format. The timeseries contains a few missing values that are labeled as 
										#VALUE!
